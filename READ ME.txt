** Please find "READ ME" files - one in each folder: 
   "Simulation code" and "Lattice generator code"

** The folder "Simulation code" consist of MATLAB files 
   that will run a simulation over the dimensionless
   differential equations, describing Notch mediated
   lateral inhibition that takes into account contact area.

** The folder "Lattice generator code" consist of MATLAB files
   that will generate lattice matlab file, which is nessecerry
   for the code in "Simulation code" folder.
   NOTE that some example lattice files are already included in
   the "Simulation code" folder.
