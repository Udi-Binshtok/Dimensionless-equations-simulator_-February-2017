Hello

++ The current program is in MATLAB syntex.

++ The code was written by Udi Binshtok as part of PhD project. 

++ The code was mainly used to establish the computer simulation part in the paper:
   "Cell-cell contact area affects Notch signaling and Notch-dependent patterning"
   By Udi Binshtok et al. 
	from the group of David Sprinzak Lab at the
	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wise Faculty of Life Science,
	Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel 

   The differnertial equations, which the program solves, are found in this paper.

++ Run the RUN script and it will initiate the program.

++ Some lattices are attached in the main folder and in the folder "20 lattices".
   All of the lattices were generated 
   by Micha Hersch at the
	Department of Medical Genetics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, 
	Switzerland Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland 


++ See RUN, dimensionless and defaultparams (in "Nearest neighbors functions" folder) scripts 
   for more insight about the program.

++ In any question or suggestion, you are welcome to address me at my email:
   udi.binshtok@gmail.com

Enjoy,
Udi
